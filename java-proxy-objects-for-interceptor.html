            <p>
                Maybe you heard something about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern">design 
            	patterns</a> before. Design patterns could be 
            	useful for your developer life as they shows you some good practices for various situations, which 
            	can occur during software development. In our post we will implement 
            	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interceptor_pattern">Interceptor</a> pattern.
            </p>
            <p>
            	
            </p>
            <p>
            	In Java there are some interesting language / API constructs since version 1.5. 
            	In our current article, we will be interested especially in 
            	<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/annotations/index.html">annotations</a> 
            	and <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/reflection/proxy.html">proxy</a> objects. 
            	If you work with 
            	<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/giwhb.html">
            	<abbr title="Contexts and Depency Injection">CDI</abbr></a>, you probably know the concept of 
            	interceptors there. We will implement it similar way, but without need of <abbr title="Contexts and Depency Injection">CDI</abbr>. 
            	It can be useful 
            	for some older <abbr title="Java Enterprise Edition">JEE</abbr> projects or other Java 
            	projects, where <abbr title="Contexts and Depency Injection">CDI</abbr> can't be used.
            	</p>
            	<p>
            	Ok, let's start with some motivation why we should thing about it. Imagine you have a service 
            	class, which contains the following method: 
            	</p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">
            public void output(String msg) {
            	System.out.println(msg);			// Actual action code.
            }
            </pre>
            <p>
                This method takes one String argument and print it out. Everything should work ok. But now what 
                if there is a need to perform this action transactionally? So basically we need to perform some 
                action at the beginning and at the end of the method. We have something like this: 
            </p> 
            <pre class="prettyprint">
            public void output(String msg) {
            	System.out.println("--Start Transaction");	// Code for transaction start.
            	System.out.println(msg);			// Actual action code.
            	System.out.println("--End Transaction");	// Code for transaction end.
            }
            </pre>
            <p>
            	It is working well now, but it is not ideal. As you can see these actions for transaction 
            	are unrelated to the business logic of the method (business logic is to print out String). But we 
            	need them. Even worse - if we have let's say hundreds of methods in our project containing 
            	transactional behavior done this way and want to change for example 
            	<code>"--Start Transaction"</code> to <code>"--Begin Transaction"</code>, you are in trouble. Of course, 
            	you can create methods like <code>beginTransaction()</code>, <code>endTransaction()</code> and write 
            	something like this:
            	</p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">
            public void output(String msg) {
            	beginTransaction();				// Code for transaction start.
            	System.out.println(msg);			// Actual action code.
            	endTransaction();				// Code for transaction end.
            }
            </pre>
            <p>
            	But still you have code unrelated to the business logic mixed in. There must be something better...
            </p>
            <h3>Proxy objects to the rescue.</h3>
            <p>
            	Our goal is to have transactional behavior defined somehow declarative. For this declarative 
            	approach, annotations help us a lot. The result will look like:
            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">
            @Transaction
            public void output(String msg) {
            	System.out.println(msg);			// Actual action code.
            }
            </pre>
            <p>
            	Maybe it is good idea to explain, what the proxy object is. Basically it is an object, which 
            	mimics class and properties of given regular object. Additionally proxy object allow us 
            	to control method execution. We are then able to <mark>intercept</mark> actual execution and 
            	we can perform own actions during execution.
            </p>
            <p>
            	At first, we define the annotation <code>@Transaction</code>. It will help us to recognize, 
            	which method should be transactional-aware. Methods, which are not annotated will be processed 
            	in normal way.
            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">
            @Target(ElementType.METHOD)
            @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
            public @interface Transaction {
            
            }
            </pre>
            <p>
            	Now we must implement some code, which will do an actual method calling interception. In terms of 
            	Java proxy object, it is called <mark>invocation handler</mark> and this code is called for 
            	<strong>every</strong> single method invocation of defined proxy object.
            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">
            public class MyInvocationHandler&lt;T&gt; implements InvocationHandler {
            
                private final T proxied;
            
                public MyInvocationHandler(T proxied) {
                    this.proxied = proxied;
                }
            
                @Override
                public Object invoke(Object proxy, Method method, Object[] args) throws Throwable {
                    Object result;
                    Method m = proxied.getClass().getMethod(method.getName(), method.getParameterTypes());
                    if (m.isAnnotationPresent(Transaction.class)) {
                        System.out.println("--Start Transaction");
                        result = method.invoke(proxied, args);
                        System.out.println("--End Transaction");
                    } else {
                        result = method.invoke(proxied, args);
                    }
                    return result;
                }
            }
            </pre>
            <p>
            	Let me explain the code a little. As you can see our class is generic, which helps us to 
            	implement it universally without dealing with potentially dangerous type casting. Class must 
            	implement <code>InvocationHandler</code> interface. Method <code>Object invoke(Object proxy, 
            	Method method, Object[] args)</code> must be overridden and it contains all necessary code 
            	for interceptor. On <code>if (m.isAnnotationPresent(Transaction.class))</code> we are 
            	testing, if our annotation is present and if so we perform start transaction, method invocation 
            	and end transaction. Code <code>result = method.invoke(proxied, args);</code> is actual method 
            	invocation, result of it is stored in the <code>result</code> variable. If there is no annotation, 
            	we only perform method invocation itself. That's it. Now we only need the way, how the proxy object 
            	with our invocation handler could be instantiated.
            </p>
            <p>
            	Instead of standard instantiation like <code>Object o = new Object();</code>, we must create proxy 
            	object based on regular object's instance.
            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">
            MyInvocationHandler<Service> invocationHandler = new MyInvocationHandler<Service>(new ServiceImpl());
            Service service = (Service) Proxy.newProxyInstance(ServiceImpl.class.getClassLoader(),
                      new Class[]{Service.class}, invocationHandler);
            </pre>
            <p>
            	And now we have in variable <code>service</code> proxy object, which behaves the same way as 
            	<code>Service</code> object instance itself. Only difference is, that we can control method 
            	invocations thru the invocation handler.
